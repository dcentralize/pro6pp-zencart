##What is that folder?

This is the differences generated from the source file of magento and the modified file.

##What do the folders represent?

The folders follow the structure of zencart as found in the pro6pp folder structure.

For ease of access and clarity some folders have been ommited.
Inside the modify folder, under pages the two underscores `__` denote folders.
The left part is the folders and the right part the file.

##In which order where the diff files generated?

The source file (first argument) was the original file and the new file (second argument) was the modified file for pro6pp to function correctly.

The command used is as follows: `diff -u sourceFile newFile > diffFile`
